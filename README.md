- The home page is reponsive. On desktop screens the events section takes up 1/3 of the right hand side of the screen, but on tablet and mobile devices it moves below the other sections of content.

- Image has an overlay to increase the opacity of the image to make the text clearly readable
- Hero section has a block section over the image that consists of:
   * Welcome message.
   * Sign up button that leads directly to the sign up page with a hover effect so the user knows that the button is usable.

##### About Us Section

![About us section](documentation/about-us.png)

- This is the first section on the page as it describes the main information about the group, which is a priority for users.

#### Health Benefits Section

![Health benefits section](documentation/health-benefits.png)

- This section bullet points the main benefits of cold water swimming, divided into physical and mental benefits to make it easy for the user to understand
- This section is responsive as on a desktop the two categories appear next to each other but are stacked on tablet and mobile devices.

#### Swim Saftey Section

![Swim safety section](documentation/sea-safety.png)

- This section hightlight to user the saftey consideration of sea swimming, reminding them of the potential dangers
- Each "rule" has an accompanying icon to emphasise each point and to make the content easier to take in.
- This section is repsonsive as the number of rules on each line decreases as the screen width gets narrower.

#### Events Section

![Events section](documentation/health-benefits.png)

- This section provide a list of the upcoming group events with details of place and time
- When viewed on a desktop this section is an aside to the right of the screen, but when on a tablet it falls below the other content on the page.

### Gallery

- This page highlights some of the places that group go swimming.
- This page is responsive as the number of images in a row decreases as the page width narrows.

### Sign Up

![Sign up](documentation/signup.png)

- The sign up button in the hero image navigates the user down to the sign up form section of the page.
- The name and the email inputs are required to be filled out.
- The submit button leads to a response page.

### Response

![Sign up ](documentation/signup-complete.png)

- The response page provides confirmation to the user that they have successfully submitted the form.
- The hero image link now displays the message "back to home" and when clicked takes the user back to the home page.

### Max-width

- For the whole website the max width is 1900px to ensure on the largest screen sizes the content isn't stretched and so the user can take in all the information at once with minimal head movements.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Color pallet](documentation/colour-scheme.png)

- Different shades of blue were used for the website this is a colour associated with the sea and they also have a calming effect on the user giving a feeling of tranquility to the page.

### Typography

- Google font's Bellota was used for the headings.

![Headings Font](documentation/bellota-font.png)

- Google font's Indie Flower was used for the main content

![Content Font](documentation/indie+flower-font.png)

- Both of these fonts are curly and have an element of being hand written about them. This makes the website appear more friendly as it gives an informal and personal design.

## Testing

### Validation

* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run on each page to determine any HTML errors. The only error found on each page was for the type attribute value of buton on an a tag. This section of code was taken from Bootstrap, and I don't believe it is necessarily an error. More information can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button).

![index validation](documentation/index-verfication.png)

![gallery validation](documentation/gallery-verification.png)

![signup validation](documentation/signup-verification.png)

![signup-complete validation](documentation/signup-complete-verification.png)

* [CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run on the style sheet and there were no errors found.

![css validation](documentation/css-verification.png)

* Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to check performance and picked up some early contrast errors in colour choice so colours were adjusted accordingly. No other significant errors were found.

The website was tested on Chrome, Mozilla, Edge and Safari browsers with no problems found.

The website was tested on numerous sized screens including different desktop, tablet and mobile devices and was found to respond as expected to all sizes.

![index responsive](documentation/index-responsive.png)
![gallery responsive](documentation/gallery-responsive.png)
![signup responsive](documentation/signup-responsive.png)
![signup-complete responsive](documentation/signup-complete-responsive.png)

Chrome development tools was used throughout the design process to check responsiveness and breakpoints. Adjustments were made accordingly.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

1. When adding the opaque overlay to the hero image to make the hero text more visible, the title was no longer centered in the image.

Solution: both the overlay and the title container needed to be set to position absolute and centered from there.

2. When adding my gallery images, they weren't filling the whole of their container on the larger screen sizes.

Solution: set a fixed height to the container, set the image height 100% and set overflow to hidden.

#### Unsolved Bugs

None

### Mistakes

When commiting changes I was using the past tense for my commit messages. Therefore halfway trhough the project wehn I realised my mistake I changed to using present tense.
