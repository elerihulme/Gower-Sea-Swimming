   * On mobile devices: 
      - navigation bar filled with the logo to the right and a hamburger menu implemented on the right-hand side of the navigation bar.     
      - When the hamburger menu is clicked, there is dropdown menu with the links in the same order.


### Footer

* The footer is visible on all pages so that address and social media links are always available to the user

### Home Page

- The home page provides the most important information about the group demonstrating the groups aims and ethos
- The home page is reponsive. On desktop the events section takes up 1/3 of the right hand side of the screen, but on tablet and mobile devices it moves below the other sections of content.  

##### Hero Section

- Hero section has a fixed background image.
- Hero section has a block section over the image that consists of:
   * Welcome message.
   * Sign up button that leads directly to the sign up page with a hover effect so the user knows that the button is usable.

##### About Us Section

#### Health Benefits Section

- This section bullet points the main benefits of cold water swimming, divided into physical and mental benefits to make it easy for the user to understand
- This section is responsive as on a desktop the two categories appear next to each other but are stacked on tablet and mobile devices.

- Each "rule" has an accompanying cartoon to emphasise each point and to make the content easier to take in.
- This section is repsonsive as the number of rules on each line decreases as the screen width gets narrower.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Color pallet](documentation/colour-scheme.png)

- Different shades of blue were used as this is a colour associated with the sea and is aslo calming

### Typography

- Google font's Bellota and Indie Flower were used for the headings and main content respectively as the curly nature of both of these fonts is eye catching but also gives a sense of informality giving the page a friendly nature like the environment the group is trying to create.

## Testing

### Validation

* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run on each page to determine any HTML errors. The only error found on each page was for the type attribute of buton on an a tag, this was taken from Bootstrap, and I don't believe it is necessarily an error. More information can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button).
![index validation](documentation/index-verfication.png)
![gallery validation](documentation/gallery-verification.png)
![signup validation](documentation/signup-verification.png)
![signup-complete validation](documentation/signup-complete-verification.png)
* [CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run on the style sheet and there were no errors found.
![css validation](documentation/css-verification.png)
* Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to check performance and picked up some early contrast errors in colour choice so colours were adjusted accordingly. No other significant errors were found.

### Compatibility and Responsiveness

The website was tested on Chrome, Mozilla, Edge and Safari browsers with no problems found.

The website was tested on numerous sized screens including different desktop, tablet and mobile and was found to respond as expected to all sizes.

Chrome development tools was used throughout the design process to check responsiveness and breakpoints. Adjustments were made accordingly.
